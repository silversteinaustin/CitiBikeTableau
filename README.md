## Introduction
As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program, this report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the program's utilization, focusing on recent data to uncover trends and phenomena that can aid in the program's publicity and improvement efforts. The analysis is based on data collected from the Citi Bike Trip History Logs, with a particular emphasis on January 2014 and January 2015 to maintain consistency and relevance in the data examined.

## Key Findings and Phenomena
### Finding 1: Changes in Popularity by Location and Time
Station Popularity by Zip Code:
Analysis of the most popular start and end stations reveals distinct patterns in usage by zip code over the two years. In January 2014, the most popular start stations were in zip codes 10001, 10017, and 10011, while end stations were in 10001, 10017, and 10014. In January 2015, the popularity shifted slightly, with start stations in 10001, 10017, and 10003, and end stations in 10001, 10017, 10018, and 10003. This shift indicates changing preferences or developments in these areas, potentially influenced by socio-economic or infrastructural changes.

### Peak Usage Hours:
Across both years, the peak usage hours remained consistent, with the highest number of starts at 8 am, 5 pm, and 6 pm, reflecting the typical workday commute times. The least popular times were in the early hours of the morning (2 am to 4 am), highlighting the program's primary use for commuting.

### Finding 2: Variations in Trip Duration by User Type and Gender
### Average Trip Duration:
The data shows a notable difference in trip durations between user types and across genders. In 2014, customers had an average trip duration of 1,734 minutes, while subscribers had slightly longer durations, with an average of 1,800 minutes. The duration for subscribers increased slightly in 2015 to 1,835.4 minutes. This phenomenon suggests that subscribers, who are likely more familiar with the city and the bike program, tend to take longer trips. Gender-based analysis indicates that females had longer trip durations compared to males in both years, suggesting possible differences in trip purposes or preferences.

## Data Visualizations and Dashboards
The analysis is supported by 2 dashboards with 6 visualizations focusing on these findings, including maps indicating station popularity by zip code and line graphs detailing hourly usage patterns. Two Tableau dashboards were created to provide an user friendly exploration of these trends:

## Conclusions and Recommendations
The analysis uncovers two primary findings: shifting station popularity by location and consistent peak usage times, alongside variations in trip durations by user type and gender. These findings suggest areas for targeted improvement and marketing, such as enhancing station infrastructure in growing areas and tailoring communication strategies to different user demographics.

Further investigation into the socio-economic and infrastructural developments in the most and least popular zip codes could provide deeper insights into the factors driving these trends. Additionally, understanding the reasons behind the gender differences in trip durations may inform more inclusive program improvements.

The complete analysis is available on Tableau Public, providing an interactive platform for exploring the data and findings in depth. This approach ensures that the insights gained from the Citi Bike program data can effectively inform decisions and improvements to the program, benefiting both the city and its residents.
